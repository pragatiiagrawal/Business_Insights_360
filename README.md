## üß© **Problem Overview**

This project, developed as part of the **Power BI course at Codebasics**, aims to build a robust **business intelligence system** for **AtliQ**, a rapidly growing global company.

- **AtliQ** relied on **Excel** for data analytics, resulting in **time-consuming**, **error-prone**, and **inefficient** reports.
- The company faced **growing data complexity** with operations expanding across multiple countries.
- There was a lack of a **scalable system** and **real-time visibility** into business performance.
- **Excel** slowed down analytics, causing delays and **hindering decision-making**.
- Insights were lacking in **depth**, **consistency**, and **speed**, with the **Latin American market** experiencing **financial losses** due to delayed decisions.
- **Strategic planning** was hindered by **poor data visibility**, prompting the transition to **Power BI** for **dynamic**, **real-time**, and **actionable insights**.

## üåü **Project Implementation**

The development of this Power BI dashboard followed a structured approach involving data extraction, transformation, modeling, and visualization. Below is an overview of the implementation process:

### 1. **Database Design and Setup**  
- The database served as the foundation for storing and managing business data consistently across the system.  
- A **Snowflake schema** was implemented to organize data into well-structured, related tables‚Äîenhancing performance and scalability for analytics.

### 2. **Data Extraction and ETL Processes**  
- Data was sourced from multiple platforms, including **MySQL databases** and **Excel files**, ensuring comprehensive business inputs.  
- Robust **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** workflows using Python and SQL were applied to clean, normalize, and convert raw data into analysis-ready formats.  
- These processes ensured data accuracy, integrity, and consistency.

### 3. **Data Modeling**  
- Developed an integrated data model using the **Snowflake schema**, connecting over ten related tables for seamless cross-functional analysis.  
- Implemented advanced metrics and business logic using **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** to derive key KPIs and insights.

### 4. **Visualization and Reporting**  
- Built interactive dashboards in **Power BI**, incorporating visual elements such as charts, KPIs, and summary tables.  
- Features like **slicers**, **bookmarks**, and **buttons** enabled personalized navigation and drill-down analysis.  
- Published reports to **Power BI Service** for secure sharing and stakeholder access.

### 5. **Automation & Data Refresh**  
- Configured **Power BI Gateway** for automated data refresh and scheduling.  
- Enabled real-time updates and reduced manual effort through scheduled refresh intervals.
